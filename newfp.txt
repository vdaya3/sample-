Trunk-Based Delivery: A Modern Approach to Continuous Deployment

1. Introduction

What is Trunk-Based Delivery?

Trunk-Based Delivery is a software delivery practice where developers integrate small, incremental code changes directly into a single main branch (commonly called “trunk”, “main”, or “master”) and release them continuously or frequently. It forms the backbone of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD), ensuring that the software is always in a deployable state.

2. Core Concepts

2.1 Trunk-Based Development vs. Trunk-Based Delivery
	•	Trunk-Based Development focuses on how code is written and merged.
	•	Trunk-Based Delivery emphasizes how code is deployed from the trunk to production.
	•	Both aim to minimize complexity and accelerate the release process.

2.2 The “Trunk”

The trunk is the central, shared branch of the codebase. All developers commit to it or create very short-lived branches that are merged back quickly—usually within hours or a day.

3. Key Principles of Trunk-Based Delivery

3.1 Single Source of Truth

All developers work on a single branch, reducing confusion and avoiding “merge hell.”

3.2 Frequent and Small Commits

Code is committed and integrated frequently—often multiple times per day—allowing for easier debugging, faster testing, and real-time feedback.

3.3 Feature Toggles (Flags)

Unfinished or experimental features are hidden behind toggles. This allows code to be merged and deployed without exposing incomplete work to users.

3.4 Continuous Integration (CI)

Every change is automatically built and tested via a CI pipeline. This ensures a healthy and stable trunk at all times.

3.5 Deployment Pipelines

Automated deployment pipelines validate changes through environments like staging and production. Ideally, every commit to the trunk could be deployed to production.

4. Benefits of Trunk-Based Delivery
	•	Fast Feedback Loops: Developers know quickly if their changes work or break something.
	•	Reduced Integration Issues: Short-lived branches and quick merges prevent large, complex merges.
	•	Higher Release Frequency: Teams can deploy multiple times per day.
	•	Improved Code Quality: Continuous feedback and smaller commits lead to better-tested, higher-quality code.
	•	Greater Collaboration: Developers are encouraged to work together, review early, and align closely.

5. Best Practices

5.1 Keep Changes Small

Small pull requests are easier to review, test, and merge without conflicts.

5.2 Use Feature Flags Wisely

Use dynamic configuration or feature management tools (e.g., LaunchDarkly, Unleash) to toggle features safely.

5.3 Automate Everything

From testing to deployment, automate processes to minimize manual intervention and risk.

5.4 Monitor and Roll Back

Monitor your production environment and use tools that allow you to roll back quickly if needed.

5.5 Encourage Pair Programming & Code Reviews

Collaborative development supports the discipline required for trunk-based delivery.

6. Challenges and How to Overcome Them

Challenge	Solution
Risk of Unfinished Features	Use feature toggles to hide work-in-progress.
Discipline in Commits	Educate the team on making atomic, testable changes.
Test Coverage Gaps	Invest in automated unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
Fear of Deploying Often	Start with deploying to staging; improve confidence over time.

7. Comparison with Other Workflows

Workflow	Characteristics	Comparison with Trunk-Based Delivery
GitFlow	Multiple long-lived branches	Slower releases, more complex merges
GitHub Flow	Short-lived branches + pull requests	Closer to trunk-based, but often lacks full CI/CD discipline
Trunk-Based	Commit directly to trunk or short branches	Fast, lean, and optimized for CI/CD



⸻

8. Tools That Support Trunk-Based Delivery
	•	Version Control: Git
	•	CI/CD: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Jenkins, ArgoCD
	•	Feature Management: LaunchDarkly, Unleash, Flagsmith
	•	Monitoring: Datadog, New Relic, Prometheus

⸻

9. Real-World Examples
	•	Google: Most teams work on a monorepo with trunk-based practices.
	•	Netflix: Uses feature flags extensively for safe deployments.
	•	Facebook: Deploys code to production multiple times per day with trunk-based delivery.

⸻

10. Conclusion

Trunk-Based Delivery is not just a coding practice—it’s a culture shift toward collaboration, speed, and quality. It enables teams to innovate faster while reducing risk and increasing stability.

If your goal is fast, frequent, and safe delivery, Trunk-Based Delivery is the way forward.
